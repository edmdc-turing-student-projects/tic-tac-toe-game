# Solo project: Tic Tac Toe

Create a playable game of tic tac toe from beginning to end. Each player's wins and victory game board should be displayed on their respective side of the game board. These victory game boards should be a small modal of the actual game board. They should also persist accross refreshes. 
This app has very light functionality beyond the game itself. Possible extensions include: adding player names, resetting victory count, and choosing an unique token from an array of options.
